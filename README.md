In this project, I attempt to validate the common intuition that, when purchasing an specific airline itinerary, an itinerary with more layovers is cheaper than a direct flight. I conclude that this intuition is (mostly) correct. However, depending on the distance of the trip, direct flights are not always available, in which case the cheapest itinerary changes.

The following graphs visualize the results, associating the distance of the itinerary with the market fare for itineraries with different number of layovers, after controlling for: the number of passengers who have purchased the itinerary, the first (or only) operating carrier in the itinerary, and the financial quarter during which the itinerary was purchased.
