# The Effect of Layovers on Airline Itinerary Market Fare in the United States
In this project, I attempt to validate the common intuition that, when purchasing an specific airline itinerary, an itinerary with more layovers is cheaper than a direct flight. Using a multiple linear regression model which I created using stepwise selection with BIC for parsimony, including an outcome variable transformation and an interaction term, I conclude that this intuition is (mostly) correct. However, depending on the distance of the trip, direct flights are not always available, in which case the cheapest itinerary changes, but direct flights are rarely the cheapest option.
